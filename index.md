> In addition to commercial and open source work, some projects have been

> photos, videos and editorials, and was served from my home machine.

> That project provided not only the knowledge but also the interest which
> resulted in being made responsible for maintenance, upgrades and security of
> a PHPBB2 instance, and the development of a [new front page][aeng] for the

## //tech

### /experience

These are technologies I've had cause to become familiar (and for the most
part, comfortable) using to build cool things. Which as we all know \.\.\.
isn't the same as _wanting_ to use them. Yes, I'm looking at you `java` and
`php`! D:

`chef`, `cors`, `dremio`, `elasticsearch`, `es6`, `git`, `html`, `javascript`,
`linux`, `make`, `nginx`, `php`, `posix`, `python2`, `python3`, `renpy`,
`ruby`, `storm`, `sql`, `svg`, `tmux`, `vim`

### /dabble

And these are some technologies I've dabbled in at various points, often to
scratch a very specific itch, but have not otherwise worked with extensively.

`acme`, `acucobol`, `actionscript`, `autohotkey`, `c#`, `c`, `cassandara`,
`go`, `java`, `jquery`, `lua`, `pl/sql`, `sbt`
